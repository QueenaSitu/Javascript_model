			<p id="statement">
			I was inspired by a game I played where in order to open this secret passage you have to turn this object around until the shadow casted on the wall resembled an eagle. I 3D modeled an object in Maya and used WEBGL to make the obj interactive. With Javascript and using the P5.js editor, I was able to make the object turnable and working on mobile. The background planes, point-lights, object material, and colors were also written in the P5.js editor.

				<u><b>Directions:</b></u> <em>Turn the object around until you see a form that is recognizable. What do you see? </em>
